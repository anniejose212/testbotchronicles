description: A beginner-friendly explanation of APIs with a real-world example.

An **API** (Application Programming Interface) allows two applications to communicate and share data with each other.  
Think of it as a **waiter in a restaurant** — taking your request, delivering it to the kitchen, and bringing back your order.

## 🔍 **Key Points About APIs**
- **Purpose:** Enable communication between software systems.
- **Format:** Often uses JSON or XML to exchange data.
- **Types:** REST, SOAP, GraphQL, WebSocket, etc.
- **Security:** Often uses API keys, tokens, or OAuth.

## 📌 **Example: Weather App**
- You open a weather app and search for “Melbourne.”
- The app sends a request to a **Weather API** with your location.
- The API connects to a weather database, fetches the data, and sends it back.
- Your app displays the temperature, humidity, and forecast.

✅ **Why APIs Are Important**
- Allow integration between different services (e.g., PayPal payments on e-commerce sites).
- Save time — developers don’t need to build everything from scratch.
- Support automation and scalability.
