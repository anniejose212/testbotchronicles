# The Purpose of GitHub

GitHub is a **web-based platform** built on top of Git, the distributed version control system. It provides a central place for storing, managing, and collaborating on code ‚Äî making it essential for both open-source and enterprise development.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Centralized Code Hosting
GitHub hosts repositories in the cloud, enabling developers to store code securely and access it from anywhere.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Collaboration Made Easy
With **pull requests**, code reviews, and issue tracking, teams can collaborate effectively without overwriting each other‚Äôs work.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Version Control with Git
Every change is tracked, and developers can roll back to previous versions, compare changes, and merge updates with confidence.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Project Management Tools
GitHub offers **project boards**, milestones, and integrated workflows to keep development organized and aligned with business goals.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Integration & Automation
Supports integrations with CI/CD tools, automated testing, and deployment pipelines, streamlining the entire development lifecycle.
