In the world of software and web applications, the terms **"client"** and **"server"** are used frequently. They are key components of how information is delivered across networks like the internet.  

Let’s break down what each of these means and how they work together.

## 💻 What is a Client?

A **client** is any device or application that sends a request to another device or application to get some data or service.  

Examples include:
- 🌐 A web browser like **Chrome** or **Firefox**
- 📱 A mobile app like *Instagram* or *WhatsApp*
- 💻 A computer accessing a network file

Clients interact with servers by **sending requests** and **receiving responses**.

## 🖥️ What is a Server?

A **server** is a powerful computer or software that stores data, applications, and services. It responds to requests made by clients.

Examples include:
- 🌍 A web server hosting websites
- 📧 A mail server delivering emails
- 📂 A file server storing documents

Servers are **always running** and ready to provide services to many clients at once.

## ⚙️ How Do They Work Together?

1. **Client action:** A user opens a browser and types a website URL.
2. The browser **sends a request** to the server where the website is hosted.
3. The server **processes the request** and sends back the necessary data (HTML, CSS, images).
4. The browser **renders and displays** the website to the user.

This process happens in **milliseconds** ⚡.

## 📌 Real-World Example

> You open [www.google.com](https://www.google.com) in your browser (**client**).  
> Your browser sends a request to Google’s **server**.  
> The server sends back the search page, and you can start typing your query.
