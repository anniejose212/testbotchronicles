Defect prioritisation ensures that the most impactful issues are addressed first, preventing delays in delivery and safeguarding user experience.

## ðŸ“Œ Factors Affecting Priority

1. **Impact on Functionality**  
   - Does the defect block core features?  
   - *Example:* A payment gateway failure is high priority.

2. **Frequency of Occurrence**  
   - How often does the defect appear?  
   - *Example:* A crash that happens on every login needs urgent attention.

3. **Business Criticality**  
   - Does the issue affect revenue, compliance, or customer trust?  
   - *Example:* Incorrect tax calculations during checkout.

4. **Severity vs. Priority**  
   - Severity measures the **impact** of the defect.  
   - Priority reflects the **urgency** of fixing it.  
   - A defect can be low severity but high priority (e.g., a typo in the CEOâ€™s name).

## ðŸ’¡ Priority Levels

- **P1 â€“ Critical**: Must be fixed immediately before release.  
- **P2 â€“ High**: Fix soon; impacts major functionality.  
- **P3 â€“ Medium**: Fix when possible; minor user impact.  
- **P4 â€“ Low**: Cosmetic or very low impact.

## ðŸ’¡ Example

**Defect:** Payment gateway times out during checkout.  
- **Severity:** High â€“ users cannot complete purchases.  
- **Priority:** P1 â€“ Direct revenue loss if not fixed immediately.
