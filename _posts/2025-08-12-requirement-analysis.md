# Requirement Analysis in SDLC

The **Requirement Analysis** phase is one of the most critical steps in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. It defines **what** the system must do to meet stakeholder needs, ensuring the foundation for all subsequent stages.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Capture **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.  
- Align all stakeholders on the project’s scope and goals.  
- Identify feasibility, dependencies, and potential risks early.

---

## 🛠️ Key Activities

1. **Stakeholder Meetings**  
   - Engage clients, business analysts, and end-users to gather requirements.  

2. **Requirement Documentation**  
   - Create a **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document.  

3. **Validation & Review**  
   - Confirm requirements are complete, clear, and testable.  

4. **Prioritisation**  
   - Identify must-have features vs. nice-to-have features.

## 💡 Practical Example

**Scenario:** Developing a ride-sharing app  
- Meet with drivers and passengers to understand needs.  
- Define features like ride booking, fare estimation, and driver tracking.  
- Document performance requirements such as app response time (< 2 seconds).  
- Prioritise essential features for launch and leave advanced features for later releases.

## ✅ Outcomes of This Phase
- Approved **SRS document**  
- Clear scope and objectives  
- Reduced risk of scope creep  
- A solid foundation for design and development
