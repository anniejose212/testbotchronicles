description: Examine the essential environments in software development and their role in delivering quality systems.

When building software, it’s not just coded and released straight to users.  
It goes through a series of **environments** where it’s developed, tested, and approved.  

These environments help ensure **quality, stability, and performance** before users ever see the final product.

Let’s break down the most common environments in a software development team.

---

## 🧑‍💻 1. Development Environment (DEV)

- **Purpose:** Where developers write and test code — the first stop in the software lifecycle.  
- **Stability:** Low — frequent changes and debugging.  
- **Data:** May have test data or fake services.  
- **Access:** Only accessible to developers and technical team members.

**Example:**  
A developer adds a new feature like “Login with Google” and checks if it works in DEV before moving on.

## 🧪 2. Testing/QA Environment (TEST or QA)

- **Purpose:** Where testers verify functionality, find bugs, and run test cases.  
- **Stability:** Medium — more stable than DEV.  
- **Data:** Contains test data.  
- **Usage:** Functional, regression, and integration testing.

**Example:**  
QA tests login, signup, and password reset features to ensure they work as expected.

## 🧑‍⚖️ 3. User Acceptance Testing Environment (UAT)

- **Purpose:** Used by business users or clients to verify the application meets requirements.  
- **Stability:** High
