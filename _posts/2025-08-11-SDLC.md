The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a systematic process for building software that meets quality standards and business requirements. It breaks down development into well-defined stages, ensuring efficiency, clarity, and consistency.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Stages of SDLC

1. **Planning**
   - Define the scope, objectives, resources, and timelines.
   - *Example:* Deciding that an e-commerce website will have product listings, a shopping cart, and online payments.

2. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Gather and document functional and non-functional requirements.
   - *Example:* Confirming the website must support 5,000 users simultaneously and be mobile-friendly.

3. **Design**
   - Create architectural and UI/UX designs.
   - *Example:* Wireframes for the homepage and database schema for product storage.

4. **Development**
   - Write and integrate code based on the design.
   - *Example:* Implementing the shopping cart logic and payment gateway.

5. **Testing**
   - Verify the software against requirements through various test types.
   - *Example:* Running functional tests to ensure orders process correctly.

6. **Deployment**
   - Release the software to the live (production) environment.
   - *Example:* Making the website accessible to the public.

7. **Maintenance**
   - Perform updates, bug fixes, and enhancements post-release.
