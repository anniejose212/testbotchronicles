When building software, it’s not just coded and released straight to users.  
It goes through a series of **environments** where it’s developed, tested, and approved. 

These environments help ensure **quality, stability, and performance** before users ever see the final product.

Let’s break down the most common environments in a software development team.

---

## 🧑‍💻 1. Development Environment (DEV)
- **Purpose:** Where developers write and test code — the first stop in the software lifecycle.  
- **Stability:** Low — frequent changes and debugging.  
- **Data:** May have test data or fake services.  
- **Access:** Only accessible to developers and technical team members.

**Example:**  
A developer adds a new feature like “Login with Google” and checks if it works in DEV before moving on.

---

## 🧪 2. Testing/QA Environment (TEST or QA)
- **Purpose:** Where testers verify functionality, find bugs, and run test cases.  
- **Stability:** Medium — more stable than DEV.  
- **Data:** Contains test data.  
- **Usage:** Functional, regression, and integration testing.

**Example:**  
QA tests login, signup, and password reset features to ensure they work as expected.

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ 3. User Acceptance Testing Environment (UAT)
- **Purpose:** Used by business users or clients to verify the application meets requirements.  
- **Stability:** High — stable and close to production.  
- **Data:** Usually has near-live data.  
- **Usage:** Reflects real business scenarios.

**Example:**  
A client logs in and verifies that reports are generated correctly before approving the release.

---

## 🌍 4. Production Environment (PROD)
- **Purpose:** The live environment — what actual users see and interact with.  
- **Stability:** Very High — any issues here impact real customers.  
- **Data:** Real user data and traffic.

**Example:**  
If login fails in PROD, real users can’t access the system.

---

## 🔄 Bonus: Staging or Pre-Production
- **Purpose:** A final checkpoint to mimic production as closely as possible.  
- **Usage:** Used to catch last-minute issues before release.  
- **Stability:** Very High.

| Environment | Purpose              | Users               | Stability   |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **DEV**     | Code writing         | Developers          | Low         |
| **TEST/QA** | Functional Testing   | Testers             | Medium      |
| **UAT**     | Business Validation  | Clients/Users       | High        |
| **PROD**    | Live Usage           | End Users           | Very High   |
| **STAGING** | Pre-live testing     | QA + DevOps         | Very High   |
