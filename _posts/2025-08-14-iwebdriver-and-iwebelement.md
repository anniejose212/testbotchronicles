# Understanding IWebDriver and IWebElement in Selenium with C#

In Selenium‚Äôs C# bindings, **IWebDriver** and **IWebElement** are essential interfaces that enable automation of browser actions and interactions with web elements.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ IWebDriver ‚Äî Controlling the Browser

**IWebDriver** is the main interface for controlling a browser session.  
It provides methods to:
- Launch and quit browsers.
- Navigate to URLs.
- Manage browser windows and cookies.
- Locate elements for interaction.

**Example:**
using OpenQA.Selenium;
using OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome;

IWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("https://example.com");

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ IWebElement ‚Äî Interacting with Page Elements

**IWebElement** represents a single HTML element on a web page.
It allows you to:
-Click buttons and links.
-Type text into input fields.
-Retrieve element attributes and text.
-Check visibility and enable/disable state.

**Example:**
IWebElement searchBox = driver.FindElement(By.Name("q"));
searchBox.SendKeys("Selenium C# tutorial");
searchBox.Submit();

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How They Work Together
IWebDriver controls the browser and finds elements.
IWebElement lets you interact with those elements.
Typically, you use driver.FindElement() to locate an element, which returns an IWebElement for interaction.

## üìå Conclusion:
In Selenium with C#, IWebDriver is the driver of the browser, and IWebElement is the handle to any element within that browser. Together, they form the foundation of web automation.
