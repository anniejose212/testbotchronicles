description: A simple comparison between Blackbox and Whitebox testing techniques.
---

**Blackbox Testing** and **Whitebox Testing** are two fundamental testing approaches used in QA.

---

## üñ§ **Blackbox Testing**
- **Focus:** Tests functionality without knowing the internal code.  
- **Who Performs:** QA testers.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - No coding knowledge needed.  
  - Simulates real user scenarios.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - May miss internal logic issues.  
- **Example:** Testing a login form by entering valid and invalid credentials without looking at the source code.

---

## ü§ç **Whitebox Testing**
- **Focus:** Tests internal code, logic, and structure.  
- **Who Performs:** Developers or technically skilled testers.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Finds hidden errors in logic.  
  - Optimizes code performance.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Requires programming knowledge.  
- **Example:** Reviewing and testing the algorithm inside a password validation function.
