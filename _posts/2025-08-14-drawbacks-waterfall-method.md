# Drawbacks of the Waterfall Software Development Model

The **Waterfall model** follows a linear sequence ‚Äî moving from requirements to design, development, testing, and deployment. While it works well for certain projects, it has notable drawbacks.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Lack of Flexibility
Once a phase is completed, going back to make changes is difficult and costly.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Late Testing 
Testing happens only after development, which means defects are discovered late in the process.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Poor Adaptability to Change
Any change in requirements can disrupt the entire project schedule and budget.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Delayed Feedback
Stakeholders see the working product only at the end, increasing the risk of misalignment.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Higher Risk of Project Failure
If early assumptions are wrong, the project can fail without delivering value.

**üìå Conclusion:**  
The Waterfall model is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes, but modern agile approaches often provide more flexibility and faster feedback.
