description: Understand the key differences between System, Integration, and End-to-End testing in software QA.
---

In software testing, different levels of testing ensure that applications work correctly at every stage.  
Three of the most common levels are **System Testing**, **Integration Testing**, and **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**.

---

## 🖥️ **System Testing**
- **Scope:** Tests the entire system as a whole.  
- **Goal:** Validate that the complete application meets specified requirements.  
- **Performed By:** QA testers after integration is complete.  
- **Example:** Testing a complete e-commerce website including product search, cart, and payment.

---

## 🔗 **Integration Testing**
- **Scope:** Tests how different modules or components work together.  
- **Goal:** Ensure data flows and interactions between modules are correct.  
- **Example:** Checking if the “Add to Cart” module properly communicates with the payment module.

---

## 🌐 **End-to-End Testing**
- **Scope:** Simulates real-world user workflows across the entire system.  
- **Goal:** Verify complete processes from start to finish.  
- **Example:** A customer browses products, adds to cart, makes a payment, and receives a confirmation email.
