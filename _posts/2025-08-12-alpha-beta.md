description: Learn the difference between Alpha and Beta testing in software release cycles.

Before a software product is released to the public, it typically goes through **Alpha** and **Beta** testing phases.

## üÖ∞Ô∏è **Alpha Testing**
- **When:** Before Beta, in a controlled environment.  
- **Performed By:** Internal team (QA, developers).  
- **Purpose:** Identify bugs early in development.  
- **Environment:** Simulated or partially complete product.  
- **Example:** A gaming studio tests a new game level internally before releasing it to players.

## üÖ±Ô∏è **Beta Testing**
- **When:** After Alpha, before public release.  
- **Performed By:** A selected group of external users.  
- **Purpose:** Get real-world feedback and catch usability issues.  
- **Environment:** Near-complete product in a real environment.  
- **Example:** WhatsApp releases a beta version to volunteer users to test new features.
