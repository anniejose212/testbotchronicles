**Non-functional testing** checks *how well* the system works rather than *what it does*.  
It focuses on performance, security, usability, and other quality attributes.

## 📊 **Common Types of Non-Functional Tests**

### ⚡ **Performance Testing**
- **Goal:** Check system speed, stability, and responsiveness.
- **Example:** Measuring page load time under normal and heavy load.

### 📈 **Load Testing**
- **Goal:** Assess system behavior under expected user loads.
- **Example:** 1,000 users logging in at the same time.

### 🔥 **Stress Testing**
- **Goal:** Push the system beyond limits to find breaking points.
- **Example:** Testing with extreme traffic to see when the site crashes.

### 🛡️ **Security Testing**
- **Goal:** Identify vulnerabilities and ensure data protection.
- **Example:** Checking if passwords are encrypted in the database.

### 🖥️ **Usability Testing**
- **Goal:** Ensure the system is easy to use and navigate.
- **Example:** Observing how new users interact with the app.
