description: A clear, step-by-step guide to the Software Testing Life Cycle, illustrated with a real-world example.
---

The **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)** is a structured process that defines the stages of software testing.  
It ensures testing is systematic, efficient, and aligned with project objectives.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Stages of STLC

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Understand what needs to be tested.
   - *Example:* Reviewing login requirements for a banking app.

2. **Test Planning**
   - Define the scope, approach, resources, and schedule.
   - *Example:* Deciding to test on iOS, Android, and web browsers.

3. **Test Case Design**
   - Create detailed test cases and test data.
   - *Example:* Writing a case to verify OTP validation.

4. **Test Environment Setup**
   - Prepare the environment where testing will occur.
   - *Example:* Configuring a staging server with the correct database.

5. **Test Execution**
   - Run test cases and record results.
   - *Example:* Executing functional and regression tests after a new build.

6. **Defect Reporting**
   - Log bugs in a tracking tool with clear reproduction steps.
   - *Example:* Reporting a login crash in Jira.

7. **Test Closure**
   - Prepare a summary report and sign off testing.
   - *Example:* Documenting that all critical defects are resolved.

## ðŸ’¡ Practical Example: Banking App

**Scenario:** Testing a mobile banking application  
- **Requirement Analysis:** Identify that login, fund transfer, and transaction history need testing.  
- **Test Planning:** Decide on test types â€” functional, security, performance.  
- **Test Case Design:** Prepare cases for valid and invalid login attempts.  
- **Test Environment Setup:** Install the app on test devices and connect to a sandbox database.  
- **Test Execution:** Verify transactions post-login.  
- **Defect Reporting:** Report a defect where the balance does not update after a transfer.  
- **Test Closure:** Sign off after fixes are verified.
