# Understanding CI, CD, and CT in Modern Software Development

In the dynamic world of software engineering, speed and quality are not mutually exclusive â€” they must coexist. Three pivotal practices make this possible: **Continuous Integration (CI)**, **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**, and **Continuous Testing (CT)**.

## ðŸ”¹ Continuous Integration (CI)
Continuous Integration is the practice of **merging code changes frequently** into a shared repository. Each integration is verified by automated builds and tests, ensuring early detection of defects.  
**Key benefits:**
- Detects bugs early
- Reduces integration challenges
- Encourages collaborative development

## ðŸ”¹ Continuous Delivery & Deployment (CD)
- **Continuous Delivery** ensures that software is **always in a releasable state**, but deployment to production is a manual decision.
- **Continuous Deployment** takes it a step further, automatically pushing every validated change directly to production.

**Why it matters:**
- Faster time-to-market
- Reduced release risks
- Frequent, incremental updates
