description: A clear comparison of test cases and test scenarios, explaining their purpose, level of detail, and when to use each in software testing.
---

While **test cases** and **test scenarios** are related, they differ in scope, detail, and purpose. Understanding these differences helps structure testing efforts effectively.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What is a Test Scenario?

A **test scenario** is a high-level description of what needs to be tested.  
- Focuses on **what to test**, not **how** to test it.  
- Often derived from requirements or user stories.  
- Used for planning and ensuring coverage.

**Example:**  
- **Scenario:** Verify the login functionality for registered users.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What is a Test Case?

A **test case** provides detailed steps, inputs, and expected results to verify a specific aspect of functionality.  
- Focuses on **how to test**.  
- Includes test data, preconditions, and expected outcomes.  
- Used during test execution to validate functionality.

**Example:**  
- **Title:** Login with valid credentials  
- **Steps:** Enter valid username â†’ Enter valid password â†’ Click "Login"  
- **Expected Result:** User is redirected to the dashboard.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Differences

| Aspect            | Test Scenario                             | Test Case                                       |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose           | Identify what needs testing               | Define how to execute the test                  |
| Level of Detail   | High-level                                | Step-by-step detail                              |
| Usage             | Test planning and coverage mapping        | Test execution                                  |
| Creation Stage    | Early in test design                      | Later in test design, before execution          |

## ðŸ’¡ When to Use Each

- **Test Scenario:** Early in planning to outline coverage without getting into details.  
- **Test Case:** When executing tests to ensure accurate and repeatable verification.

---

## âœ… Best Practices
- Derive scenarios directly from requirements or use cases  
- Keep test cases traceable to their scenarios  
- Avoid redundancy by grouping related cases under one scenario  
- Review scenarios and cases with the QA team for completeness
