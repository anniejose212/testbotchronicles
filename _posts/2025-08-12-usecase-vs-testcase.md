description: A clear comparison of use cases and test cases, highlighting their purpose, structure, and differences in software development.

Although both **use cases** and **test cases** are essential in software development, they serve different purposes. Understanding the distinction ensures better requirements documentation and more effective testing.

## ðŸ“Œ What is a Use Case?

A **use case** describes how an actor (user or system) interacts with a system to achieve a specific goal.  
- Focuses on **what** the system should do, not **how** itâ€™s done.  
- Written from the **userâ€™s perspective**.  
- Used for requirement analysis and functional design.

**Example:**  
- **Title:** Book a flight ticket  
- **Actor:** Passenger  
- **Goal:** Successfully book a flight online

## ðŸ“Œ What is a Test Case?

A **test case** is a set of steps, inputs, and expected results used to verify that a system works as intended.  
- Focuses on validating **specific functionality**.  
- Written from the **testerâ€™s perspective**.  
- Used during the testing phase to confirm the system meets requirements.

**Example:**  
- **Title:** Verify flight booking with valid payment  
- **Steps:** Select flight â†’ Enter passenger details â†’ Provide payment â†’ Confirm booking  
- **Expected Result:** Booking confirmation displayed with reference number
