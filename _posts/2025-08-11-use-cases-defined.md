*Discover what a use case is, its structure, and how it captures functional requirements with clarity.*

## ðŸ“– What is a Use Case?

In software development, a **use case** is a structured description of how users (or systems) interact with an application to achieve a specific goal. It focuses on **what** the system should do, rather than **how** it does it.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of a Use Case

Use cases serve as a bridge between business needs and technical design. They help stakeholders understand system behaviour without requiring technical jargon.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Components

1. **Title** â€“ A clear name for the use case  
2. **Actor** â€“ The person, system, or process interacting with the application  
3. **Goal** â€“ The outcome the actor wants to achieve  
4. **Preconditions** â€“ What must be true before the use case starts  
5. **Main Flow** â€“ The step-by-step process of interaction  
6. **Alternate Flows** â€“ Variations or exceptions in the process  
7. **Postconditions** â€“ The state of the system after completion
